# 🌍 Project WORLD

> **WORLD** is an **AI-Native Business Operating System** — an intelligent **AI Business Partner** built to help founders think better, decide better, execute faster, and continuously improve their businesses.
>
> **WORLD is NOT** an ERP, a CRM, an Accounting Software, or a Chatbot. **WORLD is an AI Business Partner.**

## Repository Purpose
This repository is the **single source of truth** for Project WORLD. All knowledge — governance, architecture, specifications, and implementation — lives here and is documented. Documentation precedes implementation.

## Master Blueprint
Development follows the frozen [Master Blueprint](/docs/blueprint/README.md): 26 volumes across five parts, built one volume at a time in approved order.

- [Volume 01 - Vision & Philosophy](/docs/blueprint/volume-01-vision-and-philosophy/README.md) — Completed
- [Volume 02 - Business Foundation](/docs/blueprint/volume-02-business-foundation/README.md) — Completed

## Documentation Overview
All documentation lives under [`docs/`](/docs/README.md) and follows a consistent, scalable framework designed to support thousands of future documents. Every section contains:

- **`README.md`** — purpose, scope, responsibilities, expected documents, and navigation.
- **`index.md`** — a document index table (Document ID, Title, Version, Status, Last Updated).

Every document is authored from the master [document template](/docs/governance/document-template.md) and conforms to the standards defined in [governance](/docs/governance/README.md).
